Learn to invest in the things that are worth investing in. You have to dedicate yourself. If you are only doing something for the sake of doing it, then it’s not worth all the trouble, and you should probably stop what you're doing. Do it for self-growth.

Keep a journal or logbook. It will always come in handy. Keep track of even the smallest of things: your usual grocery store list, the songs you need to listen to for focus, and basically just everything so that you can “grab n’ go”. But it has to be worth it, it just *has* to be worth the investment.

Plan. Planning isn’t just about being prepared, it’s the only way to accomplish your life goals. You need to have your entire life planned out A-Z in order to ever succeed in life. Set goals for yourself.
