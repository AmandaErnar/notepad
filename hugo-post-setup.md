# How to Write a Hugo Post

1) Title: short yet specific

2) Date: do not change unless recovering old work

3) Featured_Image: name images in "static/images" to match where it belongs
example - "images/from-woodsong.jpg" --> "from-woodsong.md"

4) Draft: most of the time nonexistent, set to `true` only when necessary
