***Paperback submission guidelines***

If the book has elements that go to the end of all the pages, I have to upload the manuscript in a PDF file.

Submitted manuscrips should *only* have the text and pictures; no rulers or guide lines. Everything should be 300 DPI at a minimmum.

Smaller file size = better performance w/ previewer and such

No text on spine. Cover (including spine) must be only one continuous panoramic-ish file. No graphics where the barcode is supposed to go.

Page numbers (?)

In order to qualify for distribution among libraries and schools and stuff the book has to meet some specific guidelines, but we don't rlly need extended distribution so our trim size is fine.

**For one Book**
Gutter (inner margins): 0.375 inches
Outer margins: 0.375 inches
