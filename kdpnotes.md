***Paperback submission guidelines***

If the book has elements that go to the end of all the pages, I have to upload the manuscript in a PDF file.

Submitted manuscrips should *only* have the text and pictures; no rulers or guide lines. Everything should be 300 DPI at a minimmum.

Smaller file size = better performance w/ previewer and such

No text on spine. Cover (including spine) must be only one continuous panoramic-ish file. No graphics where the barcode is supposed to go.

Page numbers (?)

In order to qualify for distribution among libraries and schools and stuff the book has to meet some specific guidelines, but we don't rlly need extended distribution so our trim size is fine.

**For one Book**
Gutter (inner margins): 0.375 inches
Outer margins: 0.375 inches

Stuff in the front (everything before page 1) appears in this order:
Title page
Copyright
Dedicaitoin
Table of Contents

minimmum page count is 24 pgs
The graphics and text have to be embedded in the PDF you submit

text has to be at least 7 pt
Make sure ev erything is consistent when submittibg
everything has to be original

expanded distribution is when people order the book from libraries and stuff, can take up to 8 weeks to qualify

Everythign must be aligned with one another. Do not lock the files whne submitting

Extend the image 0.125 inches past the page to prevent a hite border from showing up (bleed)

Everything has to fit inside of the margins which are 0.375 inches

No blank pages

All layers must be flattened and have to be 100% transparency
